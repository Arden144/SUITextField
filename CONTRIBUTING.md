### Solve an issue

Create a branch from an existing issue (or first create an issue) and work on it ü•≥

Just few things:

- Try to follow Swift code-style, indenting 4 spaces and 120 char per line
- Use documentation comments as much as you can. Update DocC documentation as well.
- Write some snapshot tests (if you're not experienced, let [me](https://github.com/ricocrescenzio95) know, I might take care of those ‚úåüèª).
